			<p>To use PI360's analysis service you'd need credits, you can get credits by using the 'Credits' menu. There are 3 types of credits: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Free</li>
				<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotion</li>
				<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Paid</li>
			</ul>			
		</div>
		
		<br>
		<div>
			<p><b>Free</b></p>
			You can obtain a free credit but there's a quota of 1 per day. In addition this is subject to availability - each month there're certain amounts of free credits available, when these are used up you'd need to wait for next month. If this is the case you'll be notified during your attempt, then you may either wait for next month or you may obtain a promotional credit.
		</div>
		
		<br>
		<div>
			<p><b>Promotional</b></p>
			Similar to free credits, it's also subject to availabilities but there're much larger amounts of promotional credits available. In addition you have a quota of 1 per social site per day. In other words, if you acquire a credit for Twitter, you can acquire another one for Facebook on the same day, provided there're still credits available this month.
			<br>
			<p><b>Note: </b>Unlike free credits, in order to get a promotional credit, you'd need to share the app in Facebook, Twitter or Yammer. In <a href="/#/app/credits/prom">Credits/Promotion</a>, simply choose a social source and click 'Get Credit'.</p>
		</div>
		
		<br>
		<div>
			<p><b>Paid</b></p>
			You may purchase credits via Android Play or Apple Store. Report generated using Paid credit is Interstitial AD free, which pops up when some sections of the report are opened.
			<br><br>
			Please note that the small AD at the bottom will always be there, but that shouldn't cause too much distractions. We need to pay for hosting and upstream AI & ML (Artificial & Machine Learning) services, our sponsor make it possible for us to continue to provide this as a free app to most users.
		</div>
		
		<br>
		<div>
			<p><b>My Credits</b></p>
			This menu lists all the credits you have acquired. 
			<!-- delete expire from records - not required since refresh will update and only 1 for each on server -->
			<!-- in other words - won't accumulate, even on client side(?) -->
		</div>
		
		<br>
		<div>
		<p><b>Note: </b>All credits carry expiry dates, currently Free Credits expire in one day, Promotional Credits expire in 3 days, Paid Credit expire in 6 months, this may change in the future. You may check expiry in the <a href="/#/app/credits/records">Credits/My Credits menu</a> <p>
